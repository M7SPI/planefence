#
#
# The web directory you want PlaneFence to write to:

	OUTFILEDIR=/usr/share/dump1090-fa/html/planefence 

#
# the directory where this file and planefence.py are located:

	PLANEFENCEDIR=/usr/share/planefence 

#
# MAXALT: only planes below this altitude are reported. Must correspond to the altitude unit set in socket30003.conf:

	MAXALT=5000 

#
# DIST: only planes closer than this distance are reported:

	DIST=2.0

#
# Latitude and Longitude of the center point of the map (see also CALCDIST below)"

	LAT=42.39663 # Latitude of the center point of the map
	LON=-71.17726 # Longitude of the center point of the map

#
# HISTTIME: number of days shown in the history section of the website:

	HISTTIME=7 

#
# CALCDIST determines if we will recalculate the distance to the plane based on the LON/LAT parameters provided above
# If set to CALCDIST="--calcdist", then:
#	- The system will recalculate the distance for every plane
#	- ATTENTION: the DIST parameter above will subsequently be interpreted in STATUTE (US) MILES
#	- If you prefer to use a different unit (km, nautical miles, etc.) please do NOT set CALCDIST="--calcdist"
# If set to CALCDIST="", then
#	- the system will interpret the distance provided by socket30003 in whatever the units are that socket30003 uses
#	- you MUST use this if your data is not in STATUTE MILES
#	- If you want to change the centerpoint of your calculations, you must change LONG/LAT in socket30003.conf. See that package
#	  for information on how to do this
#	- LON and LAT as defined above are only used in the title of the HTML page

	CALCDIST="--calcdist" # text for the header of the website

#
# MY:text for the header of the website

	MY="KX1T's" 

#
# link for $MY in the website's header

	MYURL=".."

#
# Twitter handle for PlaneTweet. Comment this out if PlaneTweet is not available or disabled
# NOTE - if this field is defined and not empty, PlaneFence WILL try to invoke PlaneTweet to send a tweet!

	PLANETWEET="PlaneBoston"

#
# The next few variables are only relevant if you are using NoiseCapt
# Note - the system figures out by itself is NoiseCapt is running (by looking at the NoiseCapt Systemd Service), so you don't need to set this here.
# The next few variables define the background colors for the cell that contains the Loudness information on the website

	RED="LightCoral" # background cell color for Loudness
	YELLOW="Gold" # background cell color for Loudness
	GREEN="YellowGreen" # background cell color for Loudness

#
# These variables define the limit values for Loudness to be show green or yellow (instead of red)

	GREENLIMIT=9 # Max. Loudness level to be shown green
	YELLOWLIMIT=16 # Max. Loudness level to be shown yellow

#
# Last, a few variables related to logging:
#
# LOGFILE indicates where we write logs to.
# Use one of these:
# LOGFILE=/path/to/logfile.log
# LOGFILE=/dev/null # this switches off logging entirely
#LOGFILE=logger # if $LOGFILE is set to "logger", then the logs are written to /var/log/syslog. This is good for debugging purposes.

	LOGFILE=/tmp/planefence.log

# VERBOSE indicates if we capture verbose information from planefence.py.
# The only valid values are VERBOSE="--verbose" and VERBOSE=""

	VERBOSE="--verbose"
