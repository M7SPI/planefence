#
#
# The web directory you want PlaneFence to write to:

	OUTFILEDIR=/usr/share/dump1090-fa/html/planefence 

#
# the directory where this file and planefence.py are located:

	PLANEFENCEDIR=/usr/share/planefence 

#
# MAXALT: only planes below this altitude are reported. Must correspond to the altitude unit set in socket30003.cfg:

	MAXALT=5000 

#
# DIST: only planes closer than this distance are reported. Again, the unit corresponds to what is set in socket30003.cfg
# default: 2 miles = 1.73795 nautical miles (which is the default unit)

	DIST=1.73795

#
# DISPLAYUNIT: the DIST unit that we should use on the web page. This can be different from the one used in socket30003.cfg
# Must be either undefined (in which case the one defined in socket30003.cfg is used, or one of [mi|km]

	DISPLAYUNIT="mi"

#
# Latitude and Longitude of the center point of the map (see also CALCDIST below)"

	LAT=42.39663 # Latitude of the center point of the map
	LON=-71.17726 # Longitude of the center point of the map

#
# HISTTIME: number of days shown in the history section of the website:

	HISTTIME=7 

#
# CALCDIST determines if we will recalculate the distance to the plane based on the LON/LAT parameters provided above
# If set to CALCDIST="--calcdist", then the system will recalculate the distance for every plane
# If set to CALCDIST="" or is undefined, then the system will interpret the distance provided by socket30003 in whatever the units are that socket30003 uses

	CALCDIST="--calcdist" # text for the header of the website

#
# MY:text for the header of the website

	MY="KX1T's" 

#
# link for $MY in the website's header

	MYURL=".."

#
# Twitter handle for PlaneTweet. Comment this out if PlaneTweet is not available or disabled
# NOTE - if this field is defined and not empty, PlaneFence WILL try to invoke PlaneTweet to send a tweet!

	PLANETWEET="PlaneBoston"

#
# The next few variables are only relevant if you are using NoiseCapt
# Note - the system figures out by itself is NoiseCapt is running (by looking at the NoiseCapt Systemd Service), so you don't need to set this here.
# The next few variables define the background colors for the cell that contains the Loudness information on the website

	RED="LightCoral" # background cell color for Loudness
	YELLOW="Gold" # background cell color for Loudness
	GREEN="YellowGreen" # background cell color for Loudness

#
# These variables define the limit values for Loudness to be show green or yellow (instead of red)

	GREENLIMIT=6 # Max. Loudness level to be shown green
	YELLOWLIMIT=12 # Max. Loudness level to be shown yellow

#
# A few variables related to logging:
#
# LOGFILE indicates where we write logs to.
# Use one of these:
# LOGFILE=/path/to/logfile.log
# LOGFILE=/dev/null # this switches off logging entirely
# LOGFILE=logger # if $LOGFILE is set to "logger", then the logs are written to /var/log/syslog. This is good for debugging purposes.

	LOGFILE=/tmp/planefence.log

#
# VERBOSE indicates if we capture verbose information from planefence.py.
# The only valid values are VERBOSE="--verbose" and VERBOSE=""

	VERBOSE="--verbose"

#
# SOCKETCONF contains the location of socket30003.cfg. This is needed to read the units that the dump1090*-yymmdd.txt logs uses.
# This should be the full path the the config file:

	SOCKETCONFIG=/home/pi/sock30003/socket30003.cfg

#
# PLANEHEATSCRIPT contains the location of the planeheat.sh. Comment it out if you don't want to generate heatmaps

	PLANEHEATSCRIPT=$PLANEFENCEDIR/planeheat.sh

#
# VERSION is the current version of PlaneFence. Do not change please

	VERSION=3.2

RAMON="yes"
